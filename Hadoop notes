Hadoop was written in java . jps command is used to know all java running processes

Start Hadoop
-----------
go inside sbin folder and run start-all.sh to start all the daemons

If hadooop was running run jps command to see NameNode is running or not (if its then hadoop is running) , single node cluster is when all is running on one system
NameNode contains meta data
File are divided into small parts called blocks , these blocks are kept in Datanodes 
SecondaryNamenode ae replication of Namenode if namenode fails it uses secondary as primaryNamenode

For web check of Namenode go to --> localhost:5070
hadoop contains files, mongodb contained documents
hadoop is not a database it contains 4 core modules


 
 First write file in hdfs
 -------------------------
 go inside bin folder
 hadoop fs -mkdir -p /june16/ebooks
 
 If a file is over 128MB it is divided into various blocks in the Datanode
